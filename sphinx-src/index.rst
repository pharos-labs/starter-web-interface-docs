  :alt: Starter Web Interface

The |Vendor| Starter Web Interface is available for your use to interface with your |Vendor| |Designer| system, allowing most standard browsers including mobile devices access to view status and control elements in your project without the need to add triggers.

By default, all of your project's groups, timelines, scenes, and triggers build the Starter Web Interface dynamically based on your configured |Vendor| |Designer| Software (v2.9 and later) project.

This interface provides you with the ability to simply interact with the configured elements through your web browser. Status of the elements are presented in real-time and manipulation of their operation is instant.

The Starter Web Interface serves as a basic web interface for any project to start using immediately, or to use as a template for building your own customised web interface.

Compatibility
#############

The Starter Web Interface is responsively designed and will automatically adjust to accommodate large (desktop) and small (mobile device) screen sizes and is optimized for use with Apple iOS devices using their web application mechanism.

The Starter Web Interface is compatible with API |API_Versions| and is compatible with |Vendor| |Designer| Software v2.9 and later. Future API version releases may require modification to ensure continued functionality.

The API setting is located in |Vendor| |Designer| Software under the Project Properties tab.
